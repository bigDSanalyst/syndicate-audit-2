# Breaking the Multiplicative Overhead in Quantum Entropy Estimation

## Abstract

> The von Neumann, Tsallis, and Rényi entropies are fundamental measures of quantum information. A
> common estimation strategy multiplies the worst-case costs of spectral transformation and
> statistical readout, leaving gaps to query lower bounds. We reduce this overhead with multi-
> level algorithms that use local normalization and precision allocation, while variable-time
> estimation accounts for the probability of reaching expensive spectral tests. With controlled
> purified access and its inverse, we obtain bounds for additive error $\varepsilon$, rank upper
> bound $R$, and fixed order $α$. Tsallis entropy estimation has near-optimal rank-independent
> query complexity $\widetilde O(\varepsilon^{-1/(α-1)})$ for $1<α<2$, when the allowed dimension
> and rank accommodate the lower-bound instances, and $\widetilde O(1/\varepsilon)$ for $α\ge2$,
> where $\widetilde O$ suppresses logarithmic factors. The first saves a factor $1/\varepsilon$;
> the second extends known integer-order scaling to noninteger orders. We also improve the von
> Neumann entropy bound from $\widetilde O(R/\varepsilon^2)$ to $\widetilde O(R/\varepsilon)$ and
> obtain $\widetilde O(R/\varepsilon)$ for noninteger Rényi orders $1<α<3$, with further bounds at
> other orders. Our functional-estimation theorem replaces the global product by a sum of local
> costs weighted by function magnitudes and spectral masses. We further estimate fixed logarithmic
> moments and entropy variance using $\widetilde O(R/\varepsilon)$ queries, providing efficient
> access to fluctuation parameters that enter finite-blocklength quantum compression and pure-
> state entanglement conversion. More broadly, our framework extends beyond entropy to a broad
> class of density-matrix functionals, offering a systematic approach toward optimal query
> complexity in quantum spectral estimation.
