# Efficient Estimation of Logical Sensitivities Through Fault-Counting

## Abstract

> Quantum error-correcting circuits are affected by multiple physical noise mechanisms, whose
> contributions to logical failure must be understood to evaluate code performance and guide
> improvements in hardware. The individual error budget contributions for an error type $i$ can be
> characterized by its logical sensitivity $ν_i = \frac{\partial p_L}{\partial p_i}$, which
> measures the response of the logical error rate $p_L$ to each physical noise parameter $p_i$.
> Normally, $ν_i$ is measured using linear fits such as finite differences, where $p_L$ is
> measured at two or more values of $p_i$ to calculate partial derivatives. In this paper, we
> develop a differentiable estimator to obtain all components of $\nabla_{\mathbf p}p_L$
> simultaneously from a single Monte Carlo data set at one noise configuration, using information
> about the underlying fault configurations. In surface code simulations with circuit-level noise,
> the estimator agrees with conventional finite differences while requiring one to two orders of
> magnitude fewer shots to achieve the same variance. We apply this technique to quantify error
> budgets, resolve sensitivities at the individual qubit level, and infer effective code distance.
> Finally, we incorporate the sensitivities into Newton root finding to locate and trace threshold
> contours in multidimensional noise models. These results provide an efficient method for
> extracting and applying logical sensitivity information from standard quantum error correction
> simulations.
