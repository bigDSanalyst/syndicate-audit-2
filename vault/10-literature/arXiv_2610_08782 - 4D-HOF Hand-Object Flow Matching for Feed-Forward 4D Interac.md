# 4D-HOF: Hand-Object Flow Matching for Feed-Forward 4D Interaction Reconstruction

## Abstract

> Existing methods for 4D hand-object reconstruction often rely on costly per-sequence
> optimization, while generative approaches typically synthesize interactions from random noise,
> which can lead to unstable interaction prediction. We introduce 4D-HOF, a feed-forward framework
> that reconstructs 4D hand-object interactions from coarse but informative estimates produced by
> vision foundation models. Concretely, we learn a conditional flow matching model that transports
> foundation-model-derived hand-object states toward an interaction manifold, allowing the model
> to correct errors in translation, rotation, and alignment in a feed-forward manner. A key
> advantage of our generative formulation is that it naturally enables test-time guidance within
> the transport process. Rather than applying a separate post-hoc optimization after
> reconstruction, we directly steer the evolving generative states using physical interaction
> constraints and observed 2D evidence, allowing the reconstruction to be refined as part of the
> generative process itself. By training the generative model on diverse datasets, 4D-HOF
> generalizes robustly to challenging in-the-wild scenarios. Experiments on out-of-domain
> benchmarks show that 4D-HOF achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing more stable and
> accurate 4D hand-object reconstructions.
