# From Mixing to Tearing: Graph Decomposition in Decentralized Optimization via Message Passing

## Abstract

> We study the minimization of sums of smooth strongly convex functions over undirected graphs,
> with each function held by one agent and communication restricted to neighbors in the graph.
> Existing decentralized methods, whether based on gossip or on routing over spanning trees,
> typically use the network to mix or aggregate information to enable {\it prescribed} local
> optimization updates. What this communication-centered viewpoint lacks is a general framework
> that uses graph structure to {\it jointly} design the optimization subproblems and the
> cooperative computation and communication through which agents solve them cooperatively. We
> develop such a framework from first principles, jointly designing the linear representation of
> agreement constraints, the blocks of the resulting dual variables (jointly optimized), and
> connected cluster of agents that cooperatively solve each block subproblem over the assigned
> subgraph. GATE (Graph-Tearing message passing) is a first instance of this framework: one
> variable per edge and tree blocks. At each iteration, agents update their assigned edge
> variables by minimizing the sum of the two endpoint cost-to-go messages and relaxing the result.
> The messages are updated through local minimizations following the tree recursion. To reduce
> per-iteration computational and communication costs, we develop GATE-S, a surrogate variant
> using tractable local models and lightweight message parametrizations. We establish linear
> convergence with a rate explicit in the interplay among function regularity, network topology,
> and the chosen partition, revealing the effects of graph decomposition. Numerical experiments
> are conducted to validate the theoretical results and evaluate the efficiency of our algorithms.
