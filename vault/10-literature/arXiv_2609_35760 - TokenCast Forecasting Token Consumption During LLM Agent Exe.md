# TokenCast: Forecasting Token Consumption During LLM Agent Execution

## Abstract

> When a large language model (LLM) agent executes the same task, token consumption can vary by
> over an order of magnitude across runs. The agent chooses its next steps based on tool feedback
> and intermediate results, while the growing context steadily inflates the input size of every
> subsequent call. The total consumption of a task is therefore hard to predict before execution
> and the prediction must be revised as the run unfolds. In this paper, we propose TokenCast,
> which learns a composable cost representation for each execution segment, recording its own
> consumption and the context growth it introduces. Composing adjacent segments yields a
> cumulative estimate that captures the extra input cost incurred when context from earlier
> segments is re-read by every later call. As execution unfolds, newly observed evidence refreshes
> the forecast, requiring no additional LLM calls and incurring a mean cumulative prediction time
> of 32.8 ms per run on SWE-bench Verified. Across 4 task suites and 6 agent models, TokenCast's
> mean absolute error reduction against the strongest comparator averages 14.5% over 96 evaluated
> combinations. In offline budget-control replay, TokenCast uses 21.3% fewer tokens on average
> than a fixed-budget policy at matched trace completion. The code is available at
> https://github.com/DEFENSE-SEU/TokenCast.
