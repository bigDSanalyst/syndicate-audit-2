# Decoupling Exploration from Optimization in RLVR

## Abstract

> Modern language models undergo reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) on top of
> already-trained checkpoints. A key promise of RLVR is the discovery of new reasoning strategies.
> In principle, a model can sample novel ideas absent from its prior training data. In practice,
> however, augmenting RLVR with strong novelty incentives has seen limited success and can degrade
> model quality. Because verifiable rewards supervise only a narrow slice of the model's knowledge
> and behavior, such degradations are difficult to recover from. Instead, we decouple exploration
> from optimization in a framework we call Exploration-Distillation (ExpDis). We train one or more
> explorer policies with a novelty bonus in the reward, filter their trajectories for correctness
> and quality, and distill them into a separate student policy. The student policy is then trained
> without a novelty bonus. We repeat the above procedure for several rounds, alternating between
> exploration and optimization. This decoupling allows us to aggressively scale exploration
> without degrading the student policy. Across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two
> model families, ExpDis outperforms DAPO at the same wall-clock budget. Moreover, we observe
> improved pass@$k$ scaling, indicating that ExpDis produces models that generate more diverse
> correct solutions.
