# Adversarial Training for Pixel Diffusion

## Abstract

> Pixel diffusion models generate RGB images directly, avoiding the bottleneck of an autoencoder,
> yet their outputs still systematically underrepresent fine-scale natural-image statistics. We
> show that adversarial learning provides an effective post-training correction for this
> deficiency. Starting from a pretrained model, we retain its original diffusion or flow-matching
> objective and add an adversarial loss to the predicted output at non-high-noise timesteps,
> leaving the model architecture and sampling procedure unchanged. To our knowledge, this is the
> first systematic study of adversarial post-training for pixel diffusion. Across two pixel
> backbones, the method jointly improves distribution fidelity, coverage, prompt alignment, and
> perceptual quality. We further investigate why it works. Frequency-band and power-law analyses
> show that the original models systematically underproduce natural-image high-frequency content,
> while adversarial post-training restores this missing spectral power. In contrast, perceptual
> loss also increases high-frequency content but sacrifices distribution fidelity and prompt
> alignment. Nearest-neighbor, recall, and matched no-GAN SFT controls further rule out
> memorization, mode dropping, and additional optimization as simple explanations. Finally, we
> examine the boundary of this effect. Under the tested latent diffusion configurations, the same
> procedure does not produce comparable joint gains and adds almost no decoded high-frequency
> power. These results identify direct output access to the image statistics being corrected as a
> key factor governing when adversarial post-training succeeds.
