# One Basis to Animate Them All: Gaussian Blendshape Distillation for Real-Time Avatars

## Abstract

> 3D Gaussian avatars support fast rendering, however, their real-time animation is often
> challenged by the costly neural inference. We address this bottleneck and show that the
> animation of pretrained avatar models can be closely approximated by a linear combination of
> identity-independent blendshapes. Building on this finding, we introduce GALA (Gaussian
> Animation via Linear Approximation), a distillation method that replaces per-frame heavy neural
> decoding with a shallow coefficient predictor and a linear blend. To improve fidelity and reduce
> memory requirements, we propose to construct the basis using block-local PCA under a rendering-
> aware metric and a memory budget. Our method learns a shallow MLP network to predict blendshape
> coefficients and applies to various animation architectures without retraining original models.
> We validate GALA by accelerating the inference of three distinct avatar models for 3D animation
> of facial expressions and full-bodies with clothing dynamics. Across these models, our
> distillation generalizes to held-out identities and reduces CPU animation cost by up to three
> orders of magnitude while preserving most of the rendering quality. Excellent results of our
> method confirm the shared linear structure of learned avatar representations and enable highly
> efficient and accurate animation at frame rates reaching up to 60fps on mobile devices. Project
