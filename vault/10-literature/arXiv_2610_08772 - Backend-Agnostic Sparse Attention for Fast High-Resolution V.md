# Backend-Agnostic Sparse Attention for Fast High-Resolution Visual Generation

## Abstract

> Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved strong performance in image and video generation,
> but the quadratic complexity of full attention makes high-resolution generation computationally
> expensive. Window attention offers an efficient alternative, yet existing methods face a
> practical trade-off: partitioned window attention typically achieves computational efficiency
> consistent with its theoretical complexity. However, isolated windows block cross-window
> interaction, often introducing visible grid-like artifacts in the generated results. Fine-
> grained sliding-window attention effectively restores interactions across neighboring windows
> and improves visual quality. However, its irregular computation patterns create a substantial
> gap between theoretical and practical speedups and require specialized kernels tailored to each
> hardware backend. To tackle these challenges, we propose BASA, a backend-agnostic sparse
> attention, which brings the best of both worlds: visual quality and practical acceleration.
> Specifically, BASA replaces visual self-attention with shifted local-window attention. By
> introducing a structured window-shifting scheme across DiT blocks, we allow tokens divided by
> window boundaries in one layer to communicate in the following layers, thereby achieving global
> information exchange and eliminating window-induced visual artifacts. Notably, our design
> introduces no additional irregular operators or customized kernels, making it readily deployable
> on existing attention backends and closing the gap between theoretical sparsity and practical
> acceleration. Experiments demonstrate that BASA achieves measured speedups exceeding 90\% of the
> theoretical estimates on FLUX and delivers a 4.52$\times$ attention speedup on Wan while
> maintaining competitive generation quality.
