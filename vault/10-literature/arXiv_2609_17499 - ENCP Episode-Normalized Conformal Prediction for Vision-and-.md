# ENCP: Episode-Normalized Conformal Prediction for Vision-and-Language Navigation

## Abstract

> Uncertainty estimation for Vision-Language-Navigation (VLN) models is a critical task since it
> can help identify ambiguous and unreliable predictions, enabling agents to make safer navigation
> decisions. As one of the most advanced uncertainty estimation frameworks, conformal prediction
> (CP) offers a promising approach for uncertainty estimation in VLN. However, given that VLN
> agent requires a sequence of steps, standard calibration in conformal prediction fails to
> provide coverage guarantee it promises over a dependent, variable-length VLN episode. To this
> end, we propose Episode-Normalized Conformal Prediction (ENCP), which rescales a nonconformity
> score by the policy's residual confidence and calibrates one maximum score per episode. Under
> exchangeable calibration and test episodes, this construction covers the ground truth at every
> step with probability at least $1 - α$, while allowing dependence among steps within an episode.
> Across four VLN policies and three nonconformity scores on R2R and REVERIE dataset, ENCP meets
> all reported empirical step-coverage targets on the seen-to-unseen evaluation. These results
> demonstrate that ENCP can provide model-agnostic uncertainty estimates, which might be useful
> for determining when a VLN agent should defer to a more capable predictor, including human
> assistance.
